# coral-reef-monitoring-using-yolov8m
This project focuses on detecting bleached and healthy coral reefs using advanced computer vision techniques. The model leverages YOLOv8m (You Only Look Once) for real-time object detection and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification, providing a robust solution to monitor coral reef health.
